# Design of pseudo-mechanisms and multistable units for mechanical metamaterials 

This repository contains accompanying code for the paper *Design of pseudo-mechanisms and multistable units for mechanical metamaterials* [[Link](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.248002)]. 

**Repo Structure:**

```
└── C++/PSO_MAIN                        # Contains C++ Codes. Is the main folder 
└── Data                                # contains sample data to run raux_original.py
└── Julia         		                # contains some Julia code
└── Original             		        # Python code for 3x3 systems. Generates D-theta
└── Python  		                    # 3x3 extended to 6x6. Generates E-theta 
└── Other                               # other codes
